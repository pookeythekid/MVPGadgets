# Enabling this means the plugin will use all of the mobs above except for
# the ones you list in the blacklist below.
# Setting this to false means you'll have to individually list off the mobs
# and their alternate names in the later settings.
simpleBlacklist: true

# Which of the mobs above should be impossible to use?
# If simpleBlacklist is set to false, this will still override the mobs you
# have listed below. If you want mobs listed below to be usable, be sure that
# they're not present in this list.
blacklist:
- GIANT

# Alternate names for creatures. List them off in the pattern shown below.
# If you want the default name for a mob to be the only option, you must
# fill in that default name, however redundant it may look.
# Here are some examples, keep them if you want to.
